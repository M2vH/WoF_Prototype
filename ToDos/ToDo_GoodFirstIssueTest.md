# Test the closing of issues

According to GitHub Help, we can close Issues using the steps discribed.

There is a test [issue](https://github.com/M2vH/WoF_Prototype/issues/45) in the workflow [project](https://github.com/M2vH/WoF_Prototype/projects/6).  

## What is it good for?

We could move the issues which are managed by the project automation directly into the `Work is Done` column and close the issue at the same time.

## A step by step

- [ ] Make some changes to this file.
- [ ] Commit the changes using `Close #45`  
This could look like the following  
```txt
Completed Issue test; Close #45
```
- [ ] Push your commit

## Your changes
